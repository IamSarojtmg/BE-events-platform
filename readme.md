# Events Platform Backend
This repository contains the backend API for the Events Platform, a project that allows a small community business to manage and share events with members. This backend handles CRUD operations for events and integrates with MongoDB using Mongoose.

## Project Overview
The backend for this project provides RESTful API endpoints that allow event management (create, read, delete) and supports interactions between users and events. It is built with Express.js and connected to a MongoDB database via Mongoose.

## Features
- Event Management: Create, update, delete, and view events.
- MongoDB Integration: All event data is stored in a MongoDB database.
- CORS Enabled: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing enabled for interaction with the frontend.
- Error Handling: Graceful error handling with appropriate status codes.

## Tech used
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications.
- Express.js: Web framework for building the REST API.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing event data.
- Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB.
- dotenv: For managing environment variables.
- CORS: Middleware to enable CORS in Express.

This is the backend of the **Events Platform** project.
